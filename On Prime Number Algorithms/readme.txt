Implementations of various algorithms for finding prime numbers ('primality tests'),
to make myself learn threading and to demonstrate the sheer exponential
improvements gained by learning some basic algorithmics.

Algorithms:
  1. NastyPrimes - brutal modular trial-division. O(n^2).
  2. EraSieve - classic Sieve method.
  3. FermatPrime - 
  4. MillerRabin
  5. 


FEATURES TO ADD: Real-time calculation and reporting of their efficiency.
A unified GUI allowing switching between models and showing formulae.
