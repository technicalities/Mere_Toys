Implementations of various algorithms for finding prime numbers, 
to make myself learn threading and to demonstrate the sheer massive.


1. NastyPrimes - brutal iteration looking for modulus 0. O(n^2).
2. EraSieve - classic Sieve method.





FEATURES TO ADD: Real-time calculation of efficiency.
A unified GUI allowing switching between models.
