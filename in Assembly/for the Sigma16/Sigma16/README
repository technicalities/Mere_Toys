## Overview


Just the M1 system assembler and emulator (now called Sys16).  There are installation problems with having both the Hydra libraries and some executables in the same package.  In particular, I want to make a folder which is 
The Hydra computer hardware description language

The current version number appears near the top of the file
Hydra.cabal.

Hydra is a Computer Hardware Description Language that supports the
design of digital circuits and computer architectures.  Hydra includes
software tools for circuit specification, simulation, and analysis, as
well as support for mathematical reasoning about circuit behavior.

Hydra is a domain specific language, and it is implemented by
embedding in the pure functional programming language Haskell
(www.haskell.org/).  A familiarity with Haskell is not required in
order to use Hydra to design circuits.

## License

Hydra is free software, and is distributed under the LGPL License
(Lesser General Public License).  See the COPYING file for the full
text of the license, and http://www.gnu.org/ for a discussion of the
licensing of free software.

## Installation

See the INSTALL file.

## Status

This is experimental software, and is currently under development.
Some features that have appeared in past versions of Hydra are not
supported in this release, although it is intended that they will be
supported in the near future.  In particular, the automated
transformations and metaprogramming tools described in some of the
research papers are not supported in this version.

## Documentation

To get started, see doc/tutorial, which introduces the system and
shows how to specify and simulate some simple circuits.

The following files are not part of the source, but are created by the
Cabal tools in order to build the package:

    dist              -- a directory containing object code files
    $HOME/.ghc        -- directory where ghc finds the package information
