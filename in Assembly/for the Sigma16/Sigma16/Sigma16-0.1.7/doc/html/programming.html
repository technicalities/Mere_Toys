    >Words</p
    ><p
    >Most real computers have words with several different sizes. It is common to have 8-bit bytes, 16-bit short words, 32-bit words, and 64-bit long words, but this terminology is not universal</p
    ><p
    >Sigma16 has only one word size: all its words are 16 bits. They are not subdivided into smaller groupings of bits, like bytes.</p
    ><p
    >Memory</p
    ><p
    >The memory consists of a set of words which are accessed by address. Each word in the memory contains 16 bits. There are no bytes, long words, etc.</p
    ><p
    >The architecture uses several primitive data types:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      ><p
	>Binary numbers, used for addresses</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Two's complement integers</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Booleans, represented in a word. Zero means False, any nonzero value means True.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Characters, represented as 16-bit unicode.</p
