    >Just the M1 system assembler and emulator (now called Sys16). There are installation problems with having both the Hydra libraries and some executables in the same package. In particular, I want to make a folder which is The Hydra computer hardware description language</p
    ><p
    >The current version number appears near the top of the file Hydra.cabal.</p
    ><p
    >Hydra is a Computer Hardware Description Language that supports the design of digital circuits and computer architectures. Hydra includes software tools for circuit specification, simulation, and analysis, as well as support for mathematical reasoning about circuit behavior.</p
    ><p
    >Hydra is a domain specific language, and it is implemented by embedding in the pure functional programming language Haskell (www.haskell.org/). A familiarity with Haskell is not required in order to use Hydra to design circuits.</p

In particular, the automated transformations and metaprogramming tools described in some of the research papers are not supported in this version.</p
