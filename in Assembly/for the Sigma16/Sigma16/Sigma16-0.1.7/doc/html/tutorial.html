    >This part of the tutorial shows how to load an assembly language program from an existing file, prepare it for execution, and then run it.</p
    ><p
    >Launch Sigma16. A window will appear with several panes, and the <em
      >Welcome</em
      > pane will be visible.</p
    ><p
    >An important piece of information is presented here: the location of the help documentation in your computer's disk. You can read the documentation using any web browser; just copy the file path (select the text, right click, and select Copy) and then paste it into the location bar in your browser.</p
    ><p
    >The help is available in two forms: a set of html pages you can read in a browser, and a single pdf file suitable for printing.</p
    ><p
    >Click on the tab labelled <em
      >Source Code</em
      >. This is where you can edit a program. Click the File menu and select Open (from here on, this will be written as <em
      >File: Open</em
      >). A dialogue box <em
      >Open file...</em
      > will pop up.</p
    ><p
    >The Open File dialogue lets you traverse the file system. On the left side, under <em
      >Places</em
      >, a collection of commonly used locations is offered. One of these is <em
      >examples</em
      >, which is a collection of Sigma16 programs. Click <em
      >examples</em
      >, and the dialogue will show the standard collection of Sigma16 example programs. In this tutorial we'll work with <em
      >Add.asm.txt</em
      >, so click that and then click Open. The text of the Add program appears in the <em
      >Source Code</em
      > pane.</p
    ><p
    >In the Source Code pane you can open programs, create new ones, edit them, and save them. For now, though, we won't make any changes to Add, but just move on and run it.</p
    ><p
    >Click on the <em
      >Assembler</em
      > tab. As you follow the normal workflow in developing a program, you'll follow the various pages from left to right. Initially the Assembler page is empty. Click <em
      >Assemble</em
      >, and the system will read in the current program (the text on the <em
      >Source Code</em
      > page) and translate it.</p
    ><p
    >The result of the translation is shown in the assembly listing. This contains two sections.</p
    ><p
    >The first section of the assembly listing shows each line of the source program. The line number appears first, followed by the memory address that the instruction on this line will be placed in. The address is given as a 4 digit hexadecimal number, and it is binary (not two's complement). Next comes the machine language code generated by the line of source code. If the line contains a two-word instruction, there will be two 4-digit hexadecimal values; for a one-word instruction there will be one hex number, and if the line doesn't produce any code these fields will be blank. After the code, the original source statement appears.</p
    ><p
    >The second section of the assembly listing is the <em
      >Symbol Table</em
      >. This shows each identifier (or &quot;symbol&quot;) that appears in the program, the address allocated for the symbol, the source code line where it was defined, and the source code lines where it was used.</p
    ><p
    >This example program doesn't produce any error messages, so we can move on. The next part of the tutorial will look at how to handle errors.</p
    ><p
    >Click the <em
      >Linker</em
      > tab. This page shows the object module, which consists of the machine language code that you've already seen in the assembler listing. If your program contains just one module, you don't need to do anything on the Linker page, so you can just skip past it. However, if the program contains several modules that need to be linked together, this page is the place to do it.</p
    ><p
    >Click the <em
      >Processor</em
      > tab. The Processor page shows the state of the processor as it runs your program, and the assembly listing is shown below, to help you follow the execution of the program.</p
    ><p
    >Click <em
      >Reset</em
      >. This clears the registers and puts the machine into its initial state.</p
    ><p
    >Click <em
      >Launch</em
      >. The current object program (which appears in the Linker page) will be copied into the memory. There are two independent views into the memory; this is convenient for looking at the machine language code in one view and the data in the other view. (Despite the two views, there is just one memory!)</p
    ><p
    >When a memory word has been modified, it is temporarily highlighted in red. The machine language code from the Add object module has been stored into the first dozen or so words of memory, and they are marked in red.</p
    ><p
    >When you launched the program, the processor status changed to <em
      >Running</em
      >. This means that the virtual Sigma16 processor is running, but the emulator is actually stopped and awaiting your command.</p
    ><p
    >At this point the pc register contains 0, meaning that the next instruction to be executed is the one in memory location 0. The ir and other registers also contain 0, but that is just the initial value.</p
    ><p
    >Click the <em
      >Step</em
      > button. The processor will execute one instruction and stop, showing the state of the machine after the instruction finishes.</p
    ><p
    >Click Step repeatedly, until the program has executed <em
      >trap R0,R0,R0</em
      >. This terminates the program, so the status changes from Running to Halted.</p
